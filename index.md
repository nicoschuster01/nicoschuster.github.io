## Career Objectives

Currently an undergrad student studying Business Analytics and Finance. I am currently reorienting myself towards another discipline, mainly one in healthcare systems engineering. Studying Finance has given me a plethora of indispensable tools that I can leverage in many settings in order to create value; however, I have recently discovered that working purely in finance is not conducive to my long term goals. By pivoting careers into a realm that is more healthcare oriented, I can add value by working on systemic issues that need addressing and will benefit more people in the long run.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include lifting and reading! These hobbies probably won't help maximize shareholder value sadly.
